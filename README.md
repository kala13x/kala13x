I'm a Software Engineer with 12+ years of experience in software development and maintenance. I'm skilled in C/C++ (POSIX, STL) and have deep experience in Linux/Unix development, WinAPI, multithreading, socket programming, and streaming protocols. I'm an open-source enthusiast, love low-level languages, and enjoy writing code. During my career, I have worked with many other programming languages like Rust, Python, C#, JS, Perl, Lua, etc.
